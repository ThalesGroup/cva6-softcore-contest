+# COREMARK® ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT 
+
+This ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is offered by Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium, a California nonprofit corporation (“Licensor”), to users of its CoreMark® software (“Licensee”) exclusively on the following terms.
+
+Licensor offers benchmarking software (“Software”) pursuant to an open source license, but carefully controls use of its benchmarks and their associated goodwill. Licensor has registered its trademark in one of the benchmarks available through the Software, COREMARK, Ser. No. 85/487,290; Reg. No. 4,179,307 (the “Trademark”), and promotes the use of a standard metric as a benchmark for assessing the performance of embedded systems. Solely on the terms described herein, Licensee may use and display the Trademark in connection with the generation of data regarding measurement and analysis of computer and embedded system benchmarking via the Software (the “Licensed Use”).
+
+## Article 1 – License Grant.
+1.1.	License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free, revocable right and license to use and display the Trademark during the term of this Agreement (the “Term”), solely and exclusively in connection with the Licensed Use. During the Term, Licensee (i) shall not modify or otherwise create derivative works of the Trademark, and (ii) may use the Trademark only to the extent permitted under this License. Neither Licensee nor any affiliate or agent thereof shall otherwise use the Trademark without the prior express written consent of Licensor, which may be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of Licensor.
+
+1.2.	Modifications to the Software.  Licensee shall not use the Trademark in connection with any use of a modified, derivative, or otherwise altered copy of the Software.
+
+1.3.	Licensor’s Use. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Licensor or any of its successors or assigns from using or permitting other entities to use the Trademark, whether or not such entity directly or indirectly competes or conflicts with Licensee’s Licensed Use in any manner. 
+
+1.4.	Term and Termination.  This Agreement is perpetual unless terminated by either of the parties.  Licensee may terminate this Agreement for convenience, without cause or liability, for any reason or for no reason whatsoever, upon ten (10) business days written notice. Licensor may terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon notice of breach.  Upon termination, Licensee shall immediately remove all implementations of the Trademark from the Licensed Use, and delete all digitals files and records of all materials related to the Trademark. 
+
+## Article 2 – Ownership.
+2.1.	Ownership. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensor is the owner of all right, title, and interest in and to the Trademark, and all such right, title, and interest shall remain with Licensor. Licensee shall not contest, dispute, challenge, oppose, or seek to cancel Licensor’s right, title, and interest in and to the Trademark. Licensee shall not prosecute any application for registration of the Trademark. Licensee shall display appropriate notices regarding ownership of the Trademark in connection with the Licensed Use.
+
+2.2.	Goodwill. Licensee acknowledges that Licensee shall not acquire any right, title, or interest in the Trademark by virtue of this Agreement other than the license granted hereunder, and disclaims any such right, title, interest, or ownership. All goodwill and reputation generated by Licensee’s use of the Trademark shall inure to the exclusive benefit of Licensor. Licensee shall not by any act or omission use the Trademark in any manner that disparages or reflects adversely on Licensor or its Licensed Use or reputation. Licensee shall not take any action that would interfere with or prejudice Licensor’s ownership or registration of the Trademark, the validity of the Trademark or the validity of the license granted by this Agreement. If Licensor determines and notifies Licensee that any act taken in connection with the Licensed Use (i) is inaccurate, unlawful or offensive to good taste; (ii) fails to provide for proper trademark notices, or (iii) otherwise violates Licensee’s obligations under this Agreement, the license granted under this Agreement shall terminate. 
+
+## Article 3 – Indemnification. 
+3.1.	Indemnification Generally.  Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless (collectively “indemnify” or “indemnification”) Licensor, including Licensor’s members, managers, officers, and employees (collectively “Related Persons”), from and against, and pay or reimburse Licensor and such Related Persons for, any and all third-party actions, claims, demands, proceedings, investigations, inquiries (collectively, “Claims”), and any and all liabilities, obligations, fines, deficiencies, costs, expenses, royalties, losses, and damages (including reasonable outside counsel fees and expenses) associated with such Claims, to the extent that such Claim arises out of (i) Licensee’s material breach of this Agreement, or (ii) any allegation(s) that Licensee’s actions infringe or violate any third-party intellectual property right, including without limitation, any U.S. copyright, patent, or trademark, or are otherwise found to be tortious or criminal (whether or not such indemnified person is a named party in a legal proceeding).  
+
+3.2.	Notice and Defense of Claims. Licensor shall promptly notify Licensee of any Claim for which indemnification is sought, following actual knowledge of such Claim, provided however that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve Licensee of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that Licensee is materially prejudiced by such failure. In the event that any third-party Claim is brought, Licensee shall have the right and option to undertake and control the defense of such action with counsel of its choice, provided however that (i) Licensor at its own expense may participate and appear on an equal footing with Licensee in the defense of any such Claim, (ii) Licensor may undertake and control such defense in the event of the material failure of Licensee to undertake and control the same; and (iii) the defense of any Claim relating to the intellectual property rights of Licensor or its licensors and any related counterclaims shall be solely controlled by Licensor with counsel of its choice. Licensee shall not consent to judgment or concede or settle or compromise any Claim without the prior written approval of Licensor (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless such concession or settlement or compromise includes a full and unconditional release of Licensor and any applicable Related Persons from all liabilities in respect of such Claim.
+
+## Article 4 – Miscellaneous.
+4.1.	Relationship of the Parties. This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between the parties. 
+
+4.2.	No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except for the rights of Related Persons under Article 3 (Indemnification), there are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement.
+
+4.3.	Assignment. Licensee’s rights hereunder are non-assignable, and may not be sublicensed. 
+
+4.4.	Equitable Relief. Licensee acknowledges that the remedies available at law for any breach of this Agreement will, by their nature, be inadequate.  Accordingly, Licensor may obtain injunctive relief or other equitable relief to restrain a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement or to specifically enforce this Agreement, without proving that any monetary damages have been sustained, and without the requirement of posting of a bond prior to obtaining such equitable relief.
+
+4.5.	Governing Law. This Agreement will be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without reference to its conflict of law principles. 
+
+4.6.	Attorneys’ Fees.  If any legal action, arbitration or other proceeding is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement, or because of an alleged dispute, breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, the successful or prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and other reasonable costs incurred in that action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.
+
+4.7.	Amendment; Waiver.  This Agreement may not be amended, nor may any rights under it be waived, except in writing by Licensor.
+
+4.8.	Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent 
+permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.
+
+4.9.	Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter.

+
+# Introduction
+
+CoreMark's primary goals are simplicity and providing a method for testing only a processor's core features. For more information about EEMBC's comprehensive embedded benchmark suites, please see www.eembc.org.
+
+For a more compute-intensive version of CoreMark that uses larger datasets and execution loops taken from common applications, please check out EEMBC's [CoreMark-PRO](https://www.github.com/eembc/coremark-pro) benchmark, also on GitHub.
+
+# Building and Running
+	
+To build and run the benchmark, type 
+
+`> make`
+
+Full results are available in the files `run1.log` and `run2.log`. CoreMark result can be found in `run1.log`.
+	
+## Cross Compiling
+
+For cross compile platforms please adjust `core_portme.mak`, `core_portme.h` (and possibly `core_portme.c`) according to the specific platform used. When porting to a new platform, it is recommended to copy one of the default port folders  (e.g. `mkdir <platform> && cp linux/* <platform>`), adjust the porting files, and run:
+~~~
+% make PORT_DIR=<platform>
+~~~
+
+## Make Targets
+`run` - Default target, creates `run1.log` and `run2.log`.
+`run1.log` - Run the benchmark with performance parameters, and output to `run1.log`
+`run2.log` - Run the benchmark with validation parameters, and output to `run2.log`
+`run3.log` - Run the benchmark with profile generation parameters, and output to `run3.log`
+`compile` - compile the benchmark executable 
+`link` - link the benchmark executable
+`check` - test MD5 of sources that may not be modified
+`clean` - clean temporary files
+
+### Make flag: `ITERATIONS` 
+By default, the benchmark will run between 10-100 seconds. To override, use `ITERATIONS=N`
+~~~
+% make ITERATIONS=10
+~~~
+Will run the benchmark for 10 iterations. It is recommended to set a specific number of iterations in certain situations e.g.:
+
+* Running with a simulator
+* Measuring power/energy
+* Timing cannot be restarted
+
+Minimum required run time: **Results are only valid for reporting if the benchmark ran for at least 10 secs!**
+
+### Make flag: `XCFLAGS`
+To add compiler flags from the command line, use `XCFLAGS` e.g.:
+
+~~~
+% make XCFLAGS="-g -DMULTITHREAD=4 -DUSE_FORK=1"
+~~~
+
+### Make flag: `CORE_DEBUG`
+
+Define to compile for a debug run if you get incorrect CRC.
+
+~~~
+% make XCFLAGS="-DCORE_DEBUG=1"
+~~~
+
+### Make flag: `REBUILD`
+
+Force a rebuild of the executable.
+
+## Systems Without `make`
+The following files need to be compiled:
+* `core_list_join.c`
+* `core_main.c`
+* `core_matrix.c`
+* `core_state.c`
+* `core_util.c`
+* `PORT_DIR/core_portme.c`
+
+For example:
+~~~
+% gcc -O2 -o coremark.exe core_list_join.c core_main.c core_matrix.c core_state.c core_util.c simple/core_portme.c -DPERFORMANCE_RUN=1 -DITERATIONS=1000
+% ./coremark.exe > run1.log
+~~~
+The above will compile the benchmark for a performance run and 1000 iterations. Output is redirected to `run1.log`.
+
+# Parallel Execution
+Use `XCFLAGS=-DMULTITHREAD=N` where N is number of threads to run in parallel. Several implementations are available to execute in multiple contexts, or you can implement your own in `core_portme.c`.
+
+~~~
+% make XCFLAGS="-DMULTITHREAD=4 -DUSE_PTHREAD"
+~~~
+
+Above will compile the benchmark for execution on 4 cores, using POSIX Threads API.
+
+# Run Parameters for the Benchmark Executable
+CoreMark's executable takes several parameters as follows (but only if `main()` accepts arguments):
+1st - A seed value used for initialization of data.
+2nd - A seed value used for initialization of data.
+3rd - A seed value used for initialization of data.
+4th - Number of iterations (0 for auto : default value)
+5th - Reserved for internal use. 
+6th - Reserved for internal use. 
+7th - For malloc users only, ovreride the size of the input data buffer.
+
+The run target from make will run coremark with 2 different data initialization seeds.
+
+## Alternative parameters: 
+If not using `malloc` or command line arguments are not supported, the buffer size
+for the algorithms must be defined via the compiler define `TOTAL_DATA_SIZE`.
+`TOTAL_DATA_SIZE` must be set to 2000 bytes (default) for standard runs.
+The default for such a target when testing different configurations could be:
+
+~~~
+% make XCFLAGS="-DTOTAL_DATA_SIZE=6000 -DMAIN_HAS_NOARGC=1"
+~~~
+
+# Submitting Results
+
+CoreMark results can be submitted on the web. Open a web browser and go to the [submission page](https://www.eembc.org/coremark/submit.php). After registering an account you may enter a score.
+
+# Run Rules
+What is and is not allowed.
+
+## Required
+1. The benchmark needs to run for at least 10 seconds.
+2. All validation must succeed for seeds `0,0,0x66` and `0x3415,0x3415,0x66`, buffer size of 2000 bytes total.
+    * If not using command line arguments to main:
+~~~
+	% make XCFLAGS="-DPERFORMANCE_RUN=1" REBUILD=1 run1.log
+	% make XCFLAGS="-DVALIDATION_RUN=1" REBUILD=1 run2.log
+~~~
+3. If using profile guided optimization, profile must be generated using seeds of `8,8,8`, and buffer size of 1200 bytes total.
+~~~
+    % make XCFLAGS="-DTOTAL_DATA_SIZE=1200 -DPROFILE_RUN=1" REBUILD=1 run3.log
+~~~
+4. All source files must be compiled with the same flags.
+5. All data type sizes must match size in bits such that:
+	* `ee_u8` is an unsigned 8-bit datatype.
+	* `ee_s16` is a signed 16-bit datatype.
+	* `ee_u16` is an unsigned 16-bit datatype.
+	* `ee_s32` is a signed 32-bit datatype.
+	* `ee_u32` is an unsigned 32-bit datatype.
+
+## Allowed
+
+1. Changing number of iterations
+2. Changing toolchain and build/load/run options
+3. Changing method of acquiring a data memory block
+5. Changing the method of acquiring seed values
+6. Changing implementation `in core_portme.c`
+7. Changing configuration values in `core_portme.h`
+8. Changing `core_portme.mak`
+
+## NOT ALLOWED
+1. Changing of source file other then `core_portme*` (use `make check` to validate)
+
+# Reporting rules
+Use the following syntax to report results on a data sheet:
+
+CoreMark 1.0 : N / C [/ P] [/ M]
+
+N - Number of iterations per second with seeds 0,0,0x66,size=2000)
+
+C - Compiler version and flags
+
+P - Parameters such as data and code allocation specifics
+
+* This parameter *may* be omitted if all data was allocated on the heap in RAM.
+* This parameter *may not* be omitted when reporting CoreMark/MHz
+
+M - Type of parallel execution (if used) and number of contexts
+* This parameter may be omitted if parallel execution was not used.
+
+e.g.:
+
+~~~
+CoreMark 1.0 : 128 / GCC 4.1.2 -O2 -fprofile-use / Heap in TCRAM / FORK:2 
+~~~
+or
+~~~
+CoreMark 1.0 : 1400 / GCC 3.4 -O4 
+~~~
+
+If reporting scaling results, the results must be reported as follows:
+
+CoreMark/MHz 1.0 : N / C / P [/ M]
+
+P - When reporting scaling results, memory parameter must also indicate memory frequency:core frequency ratio.
+1. If the core has cache and cache frequency to core frequency ratio is configurable, that must also be included.
+

+
+~~~
+CoreMark/MHz 1.0 : 1.47 / GCC 4.1.2 -O2 / DDR3(Heap) 30:1 Memory 1:1 Cache

+
+# Theory of Operation
+
+This section describes the initial goals of CoreMark and their implementation.
+
+## Small and easy to understand
+
+* X number of source code lines for timed portion of the benchmark.
+* Meaningful names for variables and functions.
+* Comments for each block of code more than 10 lines long.
+
+## Portability
+
+A thin abstraction layer will be provided for I/O and timing in a separate file. All I/O and timing of the benchmark will be done through this layer.
+
+### Code / data size
+
+* Compile with gcc on x86 and make sure all sizes are according to requirements. 
+* If dynamic memory allocation is used, take total memory allocated into account as well. 
+* Avoid recursive functions and keep track of stack usage.
+* Use the same memory block as data site for all algorithms, and initialize the data before each algorithm – while this means that initialization with data happens during the timed portion, it will only happen once during the timed portion and so have negligible effect on the results.
+
+## Controlled output
+
+This may be the most difficult goal. Compilers are constantly improving and getting better at analyzing code. To create work that cannot be computed at compile time and must be computed at run time, we will rely on two assumptions:
+
+* Some system functions (e.g. time, scanf) and parameters cannot be computed at compile time.  In most cases, marking a variable volatile means the compiler is force to read this variable every time it is read. This will be used to introduce a factor into the input that cannot be precomputed at compile time. Since the results are input dependent, that will make sure that computation has to happen at run time.
+
+* Either a system function or I/O (e.g. scanf) or command line parameters or volatile variables will be used before the timed portion to generate data which is not available at compile time. Specific method used is not relevant as long as it can be controlled, and that it cannot be computed or eliminated by the compiler at compile time. E.g. if the clock() functions is a compiler stub, it may not be used. The derived values will be reported on the output so that verification can be done on a different machine. 
+
+* We cannot rely on command line parameters since some embedded systems do not have the capability to provide command line parameters. All 3 methods above will be implemented (time based, scanf and command line parameters) and all 3 are valid if the compiler cannot determine the value at compile time. 
+
+* It is important to note that The actual values that are to be supplied at run time will be standardized. The methodology is not intended to provide random data, but simply to provide controlled data that cannot be precomputed at compile time.
+
+* Printed results must be valid at run time. This will be used to make sure the computation has been executed.
+
+* Some embedded systems do not provide “printf” or other I/O functionality. All I/O will be done through a thin abstraction interface to allow execution on such systems (e.g. allow output via JTAG).
+
+## Key Algorithms
+
+### Linked List
+
+The following linked list structure will be used:
+
+~~~
+typedef struct list_data_s {
+	ee_s16 data16;
+	ee_s16 idx;
+} list_data;
+
+typedef struct list_head_s {
+	struct list_head_s *next;
+	struct list_data_s *info;
+} list_head;
+~~~
+
+While adding a level of indirection accessing the data, this structure is realistic and used in many embedded applications for small to medium lists.
+
+The list itself will be initialized on a block of memory that will be passed in to the initialization function. While in general linked lists use malloc for new nodes, embedded applications sometime control the memory for small data structures such as arrays and lists directly to avoid the overhead of system calls, so this approach is realistic.
+
+The linked list will be initialized such that 1/4 of the list pointers point to sequential areas in memory, and 3/4 of the list pointers are distributed in a non sequential manner. This is done to emulate a linked list that had add/remove happen for a while disrupting the neat order, and then a series of adds that are likely to come from sequential memory locations.
+
+For the benchmark itself:
+- Multiple find operations are going to be performed. These find operations may result in the whole list being traversed. The result of each find will become part of the output chain.
+- The list will be sorted using merge sort based on the data16 value, and then derive CRC of the data16 item in order for part of the list. The CRC will become part of the output chain.
+- The list will be sorted again using merge sort based on the idx value. This sort will guarantee that the list is returned to the primary state before leaving the function, so that multiple iterations of the function will have the same result. CRC of the data16 for part of the list will again be calculated and become part of the output chain.
+
+The actual `data16` in each cell will be pseudo random based on a single 16b input that cannot be determined at compile time. In addition, the part of the list which is used for CRC will also be passed to the function, and determined based on an input that cannot be determined at run time.
+
+### Matrix Multiply
+
+This very simple algorithm forms the basis of many more complex algorithms. The tight inner loop is the focus of many optimizations (compiler as well as hardware based) and is thus relevant for embedded processing. 
+
+The total available data space will be divided to 3 parts:
+1. NxN matrix A.
+2. NxN matrix B.
+3. NxN matrix C.
+
+E.g. for 2K we will have 3 12x12 matrices (assuming data type of 32b 12(len)*12(wid)*4(size)*3(num) =1728 bytes). 
+
+Matrix A will be initialized with small values (upper 3/4 of the bits all zero).
+Matrix B will be initialized with medium values (upper half of the bits all zero).
+Matrix C will be used for the result.
+
+For the benchmark itself:
+- Multiple A by a constant into C, add the upper bits of each of the values in the result matrix. The result will become part of the output chain.
+- Multiple A by column X of B into C, add the upper bits of each of the values in the result matrix. The result will become part of the output chain.
+- Multiple A by B into C, add the upper bits of each of the values in the result matrix. The result will become part of the output chain.
+
+The actual values for A and B must be derived based on input that is not available at compile time.
+
+### State Machine
+
+This part of the code needs to exercise switch and if statements. As such, we will use a small Moore state machine. In particular, this will be a state machine that identifies string input as numbers and divides them according to format.
+
+The state machine will parse the input string until either a “,” separator or end of input is encountered. An invalid number will cause the state machine to return invalid state and a valid number will cause the state machine to return with type of number format (int/float/scientific).
+
+This code will perform a realistic task, be small enough to easily understand, and exercise the required functionality. The other option used in embedded systems is a mealy based state machine, which is driven by a table. The table then determines the number of states and complexity of transitions. This approach, however, tests mainly the load/store and function call mechanisms and less the handling of branches. If analysis of the final results shows that the load/store functionality of the processor is not exercised thoroughly, it may be a good addition to the benchmark (codesize allowing).
+
+For input, the memory block will be initialized with comma separated values of mixed formats, as well as invalid inputs.
+
+For the benchmark itself:
+- Invoke the state machine on all of the input and count final states and state transitions. CRC of all final states and transitions will become part of the output chain.
+- Modify the input at intervals (inject errors) and repeat the state machine operation.
+- Modify the input back to original form.
+
+The actual input must be initialized based on data that cannot be determined at compile time. In addition the intervals for modification of the input and the actual modification must be based on input that cannot be determined at compile time.

+Topic: Description
+        Benchmark using a linked list.
+
+        Linked list is a common data structure used in many applications.
+
+        For our purposes, this will excercise the memory units of the processor.
+        In particular, usage of the list pointers to find and alter data.
+
+        We are not using Malloc since some platforms do not support this
+library.
+
+        Instead, the memory block being passed in is used to create a list,
+        and the benchmark takes care not to add more items then can be
+        accomodated by the memory block. The porting layer will make sure
+        that we have a valid memory block.
+
+        All operations are done in place, without using any extra memory.
+
+        The list itself contains list pointers and pointers to data items.
+        Data items contain the following:
+
+        idx - An index that captures the initial order of the list.
+        data - Variable data initialized based on the input parameters. The 16b
+are divided as follows: o Upper 8b are backup of original data. o Bit 7
+indicates if the lower 7 bits are to be used as is or calculated. o Bits 0-2
+indicate type of operation to perform to get a 7b value. o Bits 3-6 provide
+input for the operation.

+

+Topic: Description
+        Matrix manipulation benchmark
+
+        This very simple algorithm forms the basis of many more complex
+algorithms.
+
+        The tight inner loop is the focus of many optimizations (compiler as
+well as hardware based) and is thus relevant for embedded processing.
+
+        The total available data space will be divided to 3 parts:
+        NxN Matrix A - initialized with small values (upper 3/4 of the bits all
+zero). NxN Matrix B - initialized with medium values (upper half of the bits all
+zero). NxN Matrix C - used for the result.
+
+        The actual values for A and B must be derived based on input that is not
+available at compile time.

+Topic: Description
+        Simple state machines like this one are used in many embedded products.
+
+        For more complex state machines, sometimes a state transition table
+implementation is used instead, trading speed of direct coding for ease of
+maintenance.
+
+        Since the main goal of using a state machine in CoreMark is to excercise
+the switch/if behaviour, we are using a small moore machine.
+
+        In particular, this machine tests type of string input,
+        trying to determine whether the input is a number or something else.
+        (see core_state.png).

+   Command line arguments. This is the preferred method if command line

+   is available on the platform, a system function which is not a stub can be

+        e.g. read the value on GPIO pins connected to switches, or invoke
